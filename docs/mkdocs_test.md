for this flavor of markdown

I like `inline code`; I can even have syntax highlighting for it,
like `#!yaml some_key: value_pair`

```yaml
code:
  blocks:
    - are
    - fun
and:
  annotations: are # possible
  like: here # (1)!
```

BBQ

```markdown hl_lines="1 3-5"

with mkdocs
it is possible to
highlight certain lines
in a text, for example
like i have done here
lol foo wtf bbq
blablablablablablabla

```

If you are running ==windows== hotkeys on a ==linux server==, expect trouble...

For example, to f\*ck shit up, run ++ctrl+alt+delete++ in a linux serial console
